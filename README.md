# Resume-Classification-Project-Group-2

## 🧠 Resume Classification using NLP & Machine Learning
This project is a machine learning-based system that classifies resumes into different job categories such as Data Science, HR, DevOps, Testing, and more. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess resume text and applies machine learning algorithms for accurate classification.

## 📌 Key Features
✅ Text preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming

✅ Feature extraction using TF-IDF

✅ Resume classification using Logistic Regression (or other ML models)

✅ Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

✅ Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Category-wise WordClouds & visual plots

## 🧰 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, NLTK)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

Development: Jupyter Notebook

(Optional) Deployment: Streamlit / Flask
